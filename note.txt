vid 3 - localstorage
  - explain json
  - explain localstorage
  - execute localstorage
  - explain with real db, you'll have to consider errors and timing

vid 4 - clean code
  - x - ternary conditionals
  - x - arrow functions
  - x - separate out more functions for readability
    - x - todoTextNotEmpty
    - x - addNewTodoData
    - x - createTodo
  - x - naming standardization with objects
    - x - Themes, Filters, DataKeys, ClassNames, Images
  - OOP
    - x - first example - check if delete button clicked
    - start doing Themes
      - show that objects get ugly with "this" and need to "bind" methods to the object when using them in callbacks
      - show also that can't use Theme.whatever in the properties itself b/c not instantiated yet
    - introduce classes
      - 'this' assumes class instance
      - arrow fxn methods - don't need to bind in constructor
    - themeManager, filterManager, todoMager
  - show how things can be now be broken into files (the object declarations can be sep files)
    - webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server
    - html webpack plugin - handles source in html file for dev/prod and copies html file into dist
    - copy webpack plugin - copy files into dist
      - do i need this for images? (obvi i do for img processing) - test without this and image processing
        [[[ 
          test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
          type: "asset/resource",
        ]]]
    - babel-loader - bundle files (import export)
    - image-webpack-loader - process images - lossless compression

things to do with js
- x - light/dark mode
- x - create new todo
- x - toggle todos as completed/not completed
- x - delete todo (with X button)
- x - clear completed todos button
- x - calculate items left
- x - filter the list active/completed

1. solve without data approach
2. solve with data approach
3. future extensions
  - drag and drop sorting
  - add date created and sorting
  - add tags/categories
  - introduce caching
    - to similuates db - starting with saved data
  - backend
  - user accounts
